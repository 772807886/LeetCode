## Problem description

Given a list of daily temperatures `T`, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put `0` instead.

### Constraints

Note: The length of `temperatures` will be in the range `[1, 30000]`. Each temperature will be an integer in the range `[30, 100]`.

## Examples

For example, given the list of temperatures `T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]`, your output should be `[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]`.
