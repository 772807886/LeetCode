## Problem description

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

## Examples

### Example 1

Given `"abcabcbb"`, the answer is `"abc"`, which the length is 3.

### Example 2

Given `"bbbbb"`, the answer is `"b"`, with the length of 1.

### Example 3

Given `"pwwkew"`, the answer is `"wke"`, with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a **substring**, `"pwke"` is a subsequence and not a substring.
